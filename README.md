The ojectif of this project is to answer the question : What are the film genres people were more into for this century?

I will answer this question by getting and analyzing data on the films ranked in imdb's top 250 films starting from 1921 to 2023.
( https://www.imdb.com/chart/top/?ref_=nv_mv_250 )

After getting the data from scrapping the webpage, I will represent the insights found in a data frame and then in a plot that will show what genres people are more into.

Then, I will go further to get the genres that are more watched for the last decade (2013 - 2023), put them in a data frame and represent them in a plot.
